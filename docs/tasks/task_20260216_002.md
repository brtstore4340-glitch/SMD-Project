## Header
- Task ID: task_20260216_002
- Title: P0-02 Define build/test/lint commands + logging convention
- Owner: Orchestrator
- Stage: Scan
- Priority: P0
- Depends on: none

## Context
- Why this matters: 🎯 Establish deterministic build/test/lint commands with a repeatable logging convention to support ingestion/scraping/reporting work on the zero-budget stack.
- Constraints:
  - Simplicity First / Minimal Impact
  - No Laziness (root cause)
  - Verification Before Done (evidence required)
  - Self-Improvement Loop (update lessons after corrections)
  - 🏗️ Zero-budget stack: Firebase Hosting/GitHub Pages + Supabase free tier (DB/Auth), limited jobs
  - 👉 APIs preferred; headless scraping only for critical dynamic sources; Gmail OAuth with multi-account mapping for non-admin roles

## Plan (Checklist)
- [ ] Step 1: Inventory existing npm scripts and intended build/test/lint flows.
- [ ] Step 2: Validate commands via sample runs; capture outputs to `tools/logs/validate_<timestamp>.log`.
- [ ] Step 3: Document the canonical commands and logging convention in PLAN/RUNBOOK/TASKS as needed.

## Patch Summary
- Files changed: (tbd)
- What changed (high-level): Define and prove build/test/lint commands; document logging convention.
- Why (root cause): Need deterministic workflows and evidence for future phases.

## Verification (Reproducible)
Commands run:
- `<command 1>`
- `<command 2>`

Results:
- ExitCodes:
- Notes:

## Evidence (Required)
- Logs: `tools/logs/validate_<timestamp>.log`
- Diff/Commit: `<hash>` or file list
- Artifacts/Screens: `tasks/evidence/<...>` (if needed)

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [ ] Acceptance criteria met (commands defined + documented; sample log captured)
- [ ] Verification passed (commands reproducible from log)
- [ ] Evidence linked (paths recorded in this file)
- [ ] Minimal impact confirmed (only necessary files touched)
- [ ] Lessons updated (if user corrected anything)
