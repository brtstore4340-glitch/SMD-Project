## Header
- Task ID: task_20260216_002
- Title: P0-02 Define build/test/lint commands + logging convention
- Owner: Orchestrator
- Stage: Scan
- Priority: P0
- Depends on: none

## Context
- Why this matters: 🎯 Establish deterministic build/test/lint commands with a repeatable logging convention to support ingestion/scraping/reporting work on the zero-budget stack.
- Constraints:
  - Simplicity First / Minimal Impact
  - No Laziness (root cause)
  - Verification Before Done (evidence required)
  - Self-Improvement Loop (update lessons after corrections)
  - 🏗️ Zero-budget stack: Firebase Hosting/GitHub Pages + Supabase free tier (DB/Auth), limited jobs
  - 👉 APIs preferred; headless scraping only for critical dynamic sources; Gmail OAuth with multi-account mapping for non-admin roles

## Plan (Checklist)
- [x] Step 1: Inventory existing npm scripts and intended build/test/lint flows (`dev`, `build`, `lint`; no tests defined yet).
- [x] Step 2: Validate commands via sample runs; capture outputs to `tools/logs/validate_<timestamp>.log`.
- [x] Step 3: Document the canonical commands and logging convention in PLAN/RUNBOOK/TASKS as needed.

## Patch Summary
- Files changed: (tbd)
- What changed (high-level): Define and prove build/test/lint commands; document logging convention.
- Why (root cause): Need deterministic workflows and evidence for future phases.

## Verification (Reproducible)
Commands run:
- `npm run lint 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath tools/logs/validate_25690216_200930.log`
- `npm run build 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath tools/logs/validate_25690216_200930.log -Append`

Results:
- ExitCodes: lint (1 — failed), build (1 — failed)
- Notes: Lint errors (unused import, `any`, `no-require-imports`, `no-empty-object-type`, missing types). Build fails due to missing props (`required` on InputProps), unused imports, missing component modules (alias imports), and breadcrumb props mismatch. See log for full list.

## Evidence (Required)
- Logs: `tools/logs/validate_25690216_200930.log`
- Diff/Commit: docs/PLAN.md, docs/RUNBOOK.md, docs/tasks/task_20260216_002.md
- Artifacts/Screens: n/a

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [x] Acceptance criteria met (commands defined + documented; sample log captured)
- [ ] Verification passed (commands reproducible from log) — fails due to current lint/build errors
- [x] Evidence linked (paths recorded in this file)
- [x] Minimal impact confirmed (only necessary files touched)
- [ ] Lessons updated (if user corrected anything)
