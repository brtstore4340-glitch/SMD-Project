## Header
- Task ID: task_20260216_001
- Title: P0-01 Repo scan + baseline evidence
- Owner: Orchestrator
- Stage: Report
- Priority: P0
- Depends on: none

## Context
- Why this matters: 🎯 Capture current repo tree, versions, and runnable scripts to ground future ingestion/scraping/reporting work with evidence.
- Constraints:
  - Simplicity First / Minimal Impact
  - No Laziness (root cause)
  - Verification Before Done (evidence required)
  - Self-Improvement Loop (update lessons after corrections)
  - 🏗️ Zero-budget stack: Firebase Hosting/GitHub Pages + Supabase free tier (DB/Auth), limited jobs
  - 👉 APIs preferred; headless scraping only for critical dynamic sources; Gmail OAuth with multi-account mapping for non-admin roles

## Plan (Checklist)
- [x] Step 1: Capture repo tree (depth-limited) and key config files list.
- [x] Step 2: Record tool/runtime versions (node, npm, any CLIs used).
- [x] Step 3: Enumerate project scripts/entry points (package.json, make-like scripts) and store in log.

## Patch Summary
- Files changed: (n/a until evidence captured)
- What changed (high-level): Record baseline state (tree/versions/scripts) into logs under tools/logs/.
- Why (root cause): Need evidence baseline before modifying ingestion/scraping/reporting flows.

## Verification (Reproducible)
Commands run:
- powershell -Command "$ts=Get-Date -Format \"yyyyMMdd_HHmmss\";$log=\"tools/logs/scan_$ts.log\";\"Repo scan $ts\" | Out-File -FilePath $log;\"=== git status ===\" | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;git status -sb | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;\"=== tree depth 3 ===\" | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Depth 3 | Select-Object FullName | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;\"=== node & npm versions ===\" | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;node -v | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;npm -v | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;\"=== package.json scripts ===\" | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;node -e \"console.log(JSON.stringify(require('./package.json').scripts,null,2))\" | Out-File -FilePath $log -Append;Write-Output $log"

Results:
- ExitCodes: 0
- Notes: Baseline evidence captured to `tools/logs/scan_25690216_122745.log`; git status recorded; tree depth 3 includes major directories; node/npm versions and package scripts logged.

## Evidence (Required)
- Logs: `tools/logs/scan_25690216_122745.log`
- Diff/Commit: n/a (evidence capture only)
- Artifacts/Screens: n/a

## Definition of Done (DoD)
- [x] Acceptance criteria met (tree, versions, scripts captured)
- [x] Verification passed (logs exist with commands + outputs)
- [x] Evidence linked (paths recorded in this file)
- [x] Minimal impact confirmed (only necessary files touched)
- [x] Lessons updated (if user corrected anything)

## Report (Final)
- Summary: Captured repo baseline: git status, tree (depth 3), node/npm versions, and package.json scripts into a single log.
- Proof it works: Evidence log `tools/logs/scan_25690216_122745.log` contains command outputs.
- Risks/edge cases: Current git status shows many modified/untracked files; future tasks should avoid unintended changes.
- Next suggested task (5-line format):
  - Context: SMD-Project, zero-budget stack, need deterministic workflows for ingestion/scraping/reporting.
  - Stage: Plan
  - Task: P0-02 — Define build/test/lint commands and logging convention (tools/logs) with sample runs.
  - Evidence required: Command list + outputs saved to `tools/logs/validate_<timestamp>.log`.
  - Definition of Done: Commands documented in RUNBOOK/PLAN/TASKS as needed; logs captured and paths recorded.
